# Preferences for _Kat Petrucci_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I like Slack a lot, so I have it on my phone. If you really need to get a hold of me, my # is 317-979-6602. I'm available most hours, short of past 2am, and not earlier than 9am.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Building a functioning web app :))
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to not worry about bothering people when I need something done that only someone else can do.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Miscommunication? I think my trying to make people happy might get in the way.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think those who are okay with B's will get B's, and put in the effort that reflects a B, and vice-versa for those who want A's
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, I don't think so.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'd say five or six, depending whether or not the week is light.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * If someone prefers one type of work over the other, we could let them work on that. (UI, UX, programming, etc.)
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Talk to them as a group, and if happens more, then talk to Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I guess compromise? People will always have differing opinions, and I think the scrum master/leader at the time will have to moderate?
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * In jobs outside of school, people have different work habits, and their teams work around it.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Since I'm an online student, I'd like to somehow have a meeting or summary of the in-class meeting.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * If we're falling behind, or need to talk about a large change.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If the change is small enough and I'm working on that area beforehand, then no.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Go with what most people want, then compromise or listen to what the one person has to say.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Have a team meeting about it maybe? Suggest to that person that maybe they could take on a mentor/leadership role instead to give others more work, and if all
   * else fails, go to Dave.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Let the team know that I'm feeling like I'm taking too much of that responsibilty on.
